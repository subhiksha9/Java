//Write a program to create a superclass called Figure that stores the dimensions of a two-dimensional object. It also defines a method called area( ) that computes the area of an object. The program derives two subclasses from Figure. The first is Rectangle and the second is Triangle. Each of these subclasses overrides area( ) so that it returns the area of a rectangle and a triangle.

class Figure
{
int l,w;
Figure(int x,int y)
	{
		l=x;
		w=y;
	}
void area()
       {
       		 System.out.println("Area of the Figure");
       }
}
class Triangle extends Figure
{
	Triangle(int b, int h)
	{
        	super(b, h);
        }

void area()
	{
		System.out.println("Area of triangle " + (l * w) / 2);
	}
}
class Rectangle extends Figure
{
            Rectangle(int k,int l)
            {
                        super(k,l);
            }
            void area()
            {
                        System.out.println("Area of rectangle is "+l*w);
            }

        {
            Rectangle obj1 = new Rectangle(20, 20);
	    obj1.area();
	    Triangle obj2 = new Triangle(20, 20);
	    obj2.area();
